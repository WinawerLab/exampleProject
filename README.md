# exampleProject
A demo repository, showing an example directory layout, best practices for managing files,
and a few tricks for keeping your project organization sane and manageable

# Caveat
The point of this example is to help you preserve your sanity. If any of these ideas are more burdensome than sanity-inducing, or if you have a better way you like to do things, then you know best! If you have a good idea, maybe consider contributing it here =)

# Suggestion 1: store code, data, and figures in separate directories

TODO git

TODO .gitignores

TODO what counts as 'data'? 

TODO sort your code into subfolders however makes sense to you. Keeping top-level analysis scripts away from low-level constructors is helpful

# Suggestion 2: Use relative paths with a "rootpath" script

TODO 
 
# Suggestion 3: Keep metadata attached to data whenever possible

stimuli.mat that is just the stimuli, versus stimuli.mat that records how they were generated etc.

# Suggestion 4: Organize figures by date

TODO auto-generated datestrings for figures

# Suggestion 5: Organize scripts by date when you want old version to be frozen

TODO sort your scripts by date, especially if you want a snapshot that you don't intend to change again

# Suggestion 6: Use camelCase for your functions and variables, instead of nocapitals or underscore_separation
